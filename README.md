Aiming at the pain points of low efficiency of dating in the digital age and the simplification of the existing platform matching mechanism, this study innovatively puts forward a fusion framework of "five-dimensional dynamic partner evaluation model+federal enhanced matching system". Based on the five core dimensions of physiological quality, personality characteristics, comprehensive ability, family background and personality quality, a 25-item secondary index system is constructed, and the multi-modal feature fusion is realized through hierarchical dynamic attention network (HDAFN), and the data privacy is guaranteed by combining federal learning, and a two-way verification mechanism based on the improved Gale-Shapley algorithm is designed.
